It was argued that I was ""disrespectful"". And that the senior leaders of the division were uncomfortable! Just because I asked where we would be placed, and asked a followup. I wrote a rebuttal in my evaluation, but got no response either from the leadership of the division or HR. All that evaporated were parts of my IC and prospects upwards. Additionally, I have never been given the option of a ""skip level"" meeting, as I understand is common, and have never attended any calibration meetings, even though I was at that level.
