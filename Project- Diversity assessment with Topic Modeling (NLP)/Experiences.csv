"SkillsUseAssignments,LearningGrowth,CompensationBenefits,CareerOpportunities,Respect",2/15/2021 11:25,"After working for BGC1 for 5 years, I was recently promoted to Full-Time status. I am beyond grateful for this opportunity. However, I was given a job description which included about 16 new duties and no pay increase outside the benefits of FT pay, health benefits & PTO.  I appreciate having these added benefits, but I can't help feeling a little disrespected by the lack of pay increase offer.  I did ask, I was given .50 increase.  Oddly enough, the next piece of info is true as well.

In my new role, I've only been assigned 2 new tasks.  Another person was hired and their duties include what I feel I should learn and do to substantiate my new role and make a meaningful contribution to the organization from my position.

I honestly don't feel the new hire part has anything to do with being African-American or female (the person ref'd is also an African-American female-with whom I have a great rapport).  But, I definitely feel excluded from where I may learn, grow and contribute.",1658,727,"Leadership,HR,DirectManager",,8,,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

"WorkplaceInteractions,Other",2/15/2021 11:27,"At the last org wide training at Harland, some workshops were hosted at Clark Atlanta University. We rode BGC1 busses there. On the afternoon trip when we reached the gate to CAU, there was an orange cone blocking our entry.  A BGC1 staff hopped off the bus to remove the cone. The security guard at the gate told her not to touch the cone.  The BGC1 staff got upset and asked for the CAU's name.  It was a hot day so I understood the frustration; however, I was appalled by the audacity and the entitlement of the BGC1 staff member. None of us had any idea why the cone was there. Maybe there was a safety threat ahead. The CAU security guard happened to be African American and the BGC1 staff happened to be European American.  I'm not making it a race issue but I can't imagine the same happening at Emory University for example.  The theme of our org trainig was Seen Safe Heard.  That interaction, for me, captured how unseen Black women can be in this world.  This woman was doing her job to keep CAU students safe, and here a guest of the campus was willing to disregard and attempt to bypass her authority....We largely serve black children.
